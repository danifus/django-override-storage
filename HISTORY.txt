0.1.2
- Fix #1 bug with using override_storage and locmem_stats_override_storage as
  decorators without parenthesis.
- Change override_storage and locmem_stats_override_storage kwarg names
  to be more concise now they will be used more often after the fix of #1
  (and internal attribute names to match).
